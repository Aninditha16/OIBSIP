                    <h3>Task Manager Application</h3>
                    <p>The Task Manager Application is a web-based tool designed to help users organize and manage their tasks effectively. Users can create, edit, and delete tasks, assign categories, set due dates, and prioritize tasks based on urgency. The application offers a user-friendly interface with intuitive controls, making task management a seamless experience. Features such as user authentication ensure data privacy and security. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a backend framework like Node.js or Django, this project showcases my skills in full-stack web development and database management.</p>

                    <p>The Weather Application provides users with up-to-date weather forecasts for their location and other locations worldwide. Users can easily check current weather conditions, hourly forecasts, and extended forecasts for the next few days. The application integrates with a weather API, such as OpenWeatherMap, to fetch real-time weather data and display it in a visually appealing manner. Additional features include location search functionality, weather alerts, and the ability to save favorite locations for quick access. This project demonstrates my ability to work with APIs, handle asynchronous data, and create interactive user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
